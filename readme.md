# L-System Creator

L-System Creator made with javascript.

You can create your own L-Systems and try fun stuff with it.

I also added some predefined L-Systems, you can find most of them on [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)


But, i also found some interesting ones
* Anklets Of Krishna
* **Krishna Chakra** (made-up name)
* Snake Kolam
* Honeycomb

------

### Features
* Save your artwork in localStorage
* Load predefined Settings
* Create your own L-System (go nuts, considering performance)
